# MRI_Degad_Model

Model for the MRI Degad program

**Preprocessing:**

The preprocessing pipeline utilizes snakemake with snakebids. In order for the preprocessing pipeline to work, the input data must be in standard bids formatting.

Mri degad preprocessing python package dependencies are managed with Poetry, which youâ€™ll need installed on your machine. You can find instructions on the poetry website: https://python-poetry.org/docs/.

Setting up the environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/mackenziesnyder/MRI_Degad_Model.git
cd mri_degad_preprocessing
poetry shell 
poetry install 
```

To run the preprocessing pipeline, run the following command: 
```
mri_degad_preprocessing {input_dir} {output_dir} participant --cores all 
```

**Model Training**

This model was trained using resources provided by ComputeCanada with SLURM.
To train the model with SLURM on ComputeCanada, ensure the cloned repository is located on graham, ssh into graham, and run the following commands:

```
cd mri_degad_model
module load python/3.11.5
```

Create a virtual environment and install packages
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Run the following bash script, if you want to change any of the model parameters or resources, that can all be done in the run.sh script. 
```
sbatch run.sh 
```

**Important Note:**

To test the model you create through this program, please use data the model was not trained on. If you are running this model training end-to-end, please seperate your data before hand into model data and test data. A recommended  split is 85% model data and 15% test data. Once split, this code will take care of splitting the train and validation data. 

To test newly created models, please upload the model to OSF, switch the model link in https://github.com/mackenziesnyder/MRI-DeGad, and run the program in MRI-Degad.
